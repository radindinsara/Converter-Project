# Unit Converter Project

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a **Unit Converter** application using **Python** and **Tkinter**. The converter allows users to perform conversions between different units of measurement, including:
- **Temperature**: Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
- **Length**: Miles ↔ Kilometers
- **Weight**: Pounds ↔ Kilograms

The converter provides a user-friendly graphical interface where users can:
- Select the conversion type (Temperature, Length, or Weight).
- Input a value to convert.
- Get the conversion result displayed in a result window with color-coded backgrounds based on the selected task.

## **Goal of the Project**
The main goal of this project is to create an interactive unit converter with a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can choose between three types of conversions (Temperature, Length, and Weight) and easily convert between units.

## **Features**
- **Conversion Types**:
  - Temperature (Fahrenheit ↔ Celsius)
  - Length (Miles ↔ Kilometers)
  - Weight (Pounds ↔ Kilograms)
- **Dynamic UI**: The conversion options change based on the selected task.
- **Result Display**: Displays the result of the conversion with a dynamic background color based on the task (orange for Temperature, blue for Weight, and white for Length).
- **Error Handling**: Validates user input and displays an error message for invalid entries.

## **Installation and Requirements**

1. **Install Python**: Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Tkinter**: Tkinter is the standard GUI library in Python and is included by default in most Python distributions. If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
